# react-native-beacons-android
A React-Native library I'm using in production for handling beacons on Android.  
This library works only on Android, for iOS you should use  [react-native-ios](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-ibeacon); I tried to name the events/method like react-native-ibeacon for semplifying Android/iOS code sharing.  

### Setup  
1. The library is available on npm, install it with: `npm install --save react-native-beacons-android`.  
2. Link the library with your project:
Install [rnpm](https://github.com/rnpm/rnpm) with the command `npm install -g rnpm` and then link the library with the command `rnpm link` 
3. You're done!
